#Class Code for 10/21

##Import Data

## R Markdown

First thing we will do is to import data

```{r}
#using Read.csv for reading the CSV file
nyc <- read.csv("nycflights.csv")

# Now we will explore this data
str(nyc)
head(nyc)
tail(nyc)
summary(nyc)
```

## Calculate Intersesting Metrics 
```{r}
#Average departure delay
mean(nyc$dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
#Average Air-time
mean(nyc$air_time, na.rm = TRUE)
#Standard Deviation
sd(nyc$air_time, na.rm = TRUE)


#which origin airports has the most flights
```


## clean data

We will not need to clean data 

```{r}
#Delete the column named X
nyc$X <- NULL

#Recode Columns as factors as needed
nyc$carrier <- as.factor(nyc$carrier)
nyc$flight <- as.factor(nyc$flight)
nyc$tailnum <- as.factor (nyc$tailnum)
nyc$origin <- as.factor(nyc$origin)
nyc$dest <- as.factor(nyc$dest)

```



This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
